      title='"Well, Actually"'
      speaker="Alex Harms"
      description="Functional programmers have a reputation for being hard to work with. Ever wondered why? Every interaction is full of choices. Find out which tend to push people away, and which can help people enjoy their interactions. And learn how to tell the difference, even in the heat of the moment."

      title='Hacking Web Apps with Clojure(Script) @ Code for Denver'
      speaker="Shelby Switzer"
      co-speaker="David A. Viramontes"
      description="Over the past year, Code for Denver has embraced Clojure and ClojureScript as key technologies for civic hacking projects. This talk will draw on real-life stories from our experiences to discuss the challenges of bootstrapping devs into the Clojure ecosystem, the pros and cons of picking Clojure as a technology for web apps, and unexpected joys of building Clojure APIs and ClojureScript front-ends for good in our community. We will cover the libraries, tools, and principles you’ll need to start hacking web apps and making an impact."

      title='Get Swifty 2 Electric Bugaloo or: Intro to Functional Programming with Swift'
      speaker="Basel Farag"
      description="In Chris Eidhof and Airspeed Velocity's 'Advanced Swift' they remind us of Erik Meijer's tweet re: Swift 'At this point, @SwiftLsng is probably a better, and more valuable vehicle for learning Functional Programming than Haskell.' That may be a bit of a stretch with recent changes made to Swift--but it's not entirely without basis. In this talk I'd like to show how the language has landed itself to learning Functional Programming and why it's a great choice for those diving into FP for the first time. I'll also show how these specific components: generics, value types, protocols, closures fit in, and how one can approach Swift with the aim of learning FP for the first time."

      title='Point Free or Die: Tacit Programming in Haskell and Beyond'
      speaker="Amar Shah"
      description="<p>Point-free syntax allows you to define functions without naming their arguments. But is “point-free” just point-less? Ostensibly, tacit definitions can calibrate code to the appropriate level of abstraction. But which level is most appropriate? When is a point-free definition better than its “pointed” variation? And when is it spectacularly worse?</p><p>Let’s be explicit about tacit programming. Let’s apply eta-reduction to produce it. Let’s probe its origins in John Backus’ function-level programming. Let’s hunt for it in trusted libraries. Let’s see it amplified in languages designed for maximum quiet. Let’s speak at length, about the unspoken.</p>"

      title='Program Derivation for Functional Programs'
      speaker="Felienne Hermans"
      description="Despite what your boss thinks, programs don’t just appear straight out of specifications. But…what if they did?In this session I will show you how to systematically and step-by-step derive a program from a specification. Functional languages especially are very suited to derive programs for, as they are close to the mathematical notation used for proofs.You will be surprised to know that you already know and apply many techniques for derivation, like Introduce Parameter as supported by Resharper. Did you know that is actually program derivation technique called generalization?"

      title='Negotiating Salary for Women in Tech'
      speaker="Ashley Powell"
      description="I’ve been negotiating salary and rate with and on behalf of IT consultants for years, and firmly believe that a major contributor to the wage gap is that women don’t negotiate their salaries. So from the first job we take, we’re behind the curve and never catch up.I’ll present the theories behind how to negotiate and demonstrate how it should actually sound. We’ll cover how to understand your worth, when to stick to your guns and how to use benefits and flexibility to build a great package for yourself. I’ll give an insider’s look into negotiating with recruiters, and give you the tools to establish a firm footing for a great salary negotiation."

      title='Fetching Moths from the Works: Correctness Methods in Software'
      speaker="Brian L. Troutwine"
      description="We live in a nice world. There’s a wealth of historical thought on achieving correctness in software–shipping code that does only what is intended, not less and not more–and there are a whole bunch of methods available to us as practitioners. Some of these are hard to apply, some are easy. For instance, case testing is widely used and considered standard practice. Property testing is understood to exist but not widely used. The application of advanced logics? Way out there.
      
      If you look around you’ll find a lot of software fails a lot of the time. Why is that?
      
      In this talk I’ll give an overview of the methods for producing correct systems and will discuss each in its historical context. With each method, we’ll keep an eye out for present applications and the difficulty of doing so. We’ll discuss why there’s so much buggy software in the world. I expect there will be talk of spaceships a bit. By the end of this talk you ought to be able to make reasoned decisions about applying correctness methods in your own work and have a good shot at building better software."

      title='Recursion: Where Functional Programming Hits Bottom'
      speaker="Greg Pfeil"
      description="What are the problems with recursion? How can they be resolved while improving both the performance and clarity of your code? In this talk, we’ll learn how to separate recursion from the semantics of our program using generalized recursion schemes. We’ll discover the benefits that come from that approach and identify some pitfalls that may seem helpful at first. We will also see how to adopt this style gradually in existing projects, gaining the benefits incrementally without disrupting code that already works. Most of the content is language agnostic (but typed), with specific examples given in Haskell and Scala."

      title='Tulip: A Well-Balanced Language'
      speaker="Jeanine Adkisson"
      description="There are a lot of competing ideas about what makes a language “good”. This is because we as language designers still have no idea what we’re doing. The design of Tulip is based on careful study of a wide variety of popular and esoteric programming languages over about 4 years. Its runtime takes cues from Erlang, and its syntax is slightly like ML, but with a few key innovations designed for repl ergonomics. Tulip is one of the new languages to come out of the language community Snek, emphasizing languages by minority designers and implementers."

      title='Architecture, Front End and a Bit of Front end Architecture'
      speaker="Jan Hein Hoogstad"
      description="<p>“Lisp isn’t a language, it’s a building material.” - Alan Kay.</p><p>Architecture teaches us that there is strong connection between the history of building materials and the actual structures that are built. Introducing philosophers Walter Benjamin and Peter Sloterdijk’s thoughts on the influence of materials on the practice and theory of building, I will draw a parallel between historical buildings (such as the Sagrada Família and the Chrysler Building) and the way we build frontend applications. We will discuss how using different languages and techniques leads to different artifacts, and explore specific patterns and principles from backend development that we can use to build better architected front end software.</p><p>After my talk, attendees will know: Why and how front end structures become increasingly complex What software designers can take from the history of architecture A set of principles from back end / distributed architecture to introduce into front end architecture</p>"

      title='Embarking with Elm'
      speaker="Bradley Grzesiak"
      description="Elm touts itself as “the best of functional programming in your browser,” so we’ll explore that assertion via the language’s syntax, semantics, and ecosystem through the eyes of a relatively newcomer to the language. We’ll see how its strong types allow us to code and refactor with confidence. We will leverage the power of Elm’s impressive asynchronous task handling. And of course, we’ll enjoy some of the famously helpful compiler suggestions along the way!"

      title='Asynchronous and Real Time Control Structures on the Web
      speaker="Becky Conning"
      description="<p>Modern web applications interweave payment requests, position updates, media interactions, real time data and user interactions into powerful and valuable features. Dealing with all this asynchronicity presents a lot of complexity which is handled in many different ways.</p><p>In this talk Becky Conning presents a guided tour of the asynchronous control structures that are commonly used to manage this complexity today. She also introduces more compositional methodologies which make development faster and are ready to roll today.</p><p>Along the way she’ll walk us through practical examples in both JavaScript and PureScript. These include a visual weather report and a fast food ordering application.</p><p>This talk will inspire you to incorporate real time features into your applications, reduce the development time of asynchronous programs and realise the practical applications of functional programming.</p>"

      title='Planet 9 from Other Space, and other things found in Big(ger) Data'
      speaker="Dr. Pamela Gay"
      description="Modern all-sky surveys are enabling new kinds of discoveries by allowing statistical studies to trace out the locations of hidden planets, pressures, and exoplanets. The most exciting of these discoveries is Planet 9, a new world predicted by the orbits of icy Kuiper Belt Objects and defined by where it isn't in all-sky surveys. It follows on the heels of projects that map out invisible dark matter and describe Dark Energy's expansion of the universe.This talk will look at how massive data collections have allowed us to detect these and other things that can't be seen, and how future data sets will make today's Big Data seem small."

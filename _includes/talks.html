      title='"Well, Actually"'
      speaker="Alex Harms"
      description="Functional programmers have a reputation for being hard to work with. Ever wondered why? Every interaction is full of choices. Find out which tend to push people away, and which can help people enjoy their interactions. And learn how to tell the difference, even in the heat of the moment."

      title='Hacking Web Apps with Clojure(Script) @ Code for Denver'
      speaker="Shelby Switzer"
      co-speaker="David A. Viramontes"
      co-twitter="dviramontes_"
      description="In this talk we will cover how to build web apps in Clojure and ClojureScript, from RESTful API design and implementation to methods and tools for creating great UIs. We will use code examples and stories from open-source projects at Code for Denver."

      title='Get Swifty 2 Electric Bugaloo or: Intro to Functional Programming with Swift'
      speaker="Basel Farag"
      description="In Chris Eidhof and Airspeed Velocity's 'Advanced Swift' they remind us of Erik Meijer's tweet re: Swift 'At this point, @SwiftLsng is probably a better, and more valuable vehicle for learning Functional Programming than Haskell.' That may be a bit of a stretch with recent changes made to Swift--but it's not entirely without basis. In this talk I'd like to show how the language has landed itself to learning Functional Programming and why it's a great choice for those diving into FP for the first time. I'll also show how these specific components: generics, value types, protocols, closures fit in, and how one can approach Swift with the aim of learning FP for the first time."

      speaker="Talon Poole"
      description="We will apply a single mathematical constraint on our programmatic minds and explore the implications. Suited for beginner functional programmers. Examples will be given using ES2015."

      title='Point Free or Die: Tacit Programming in Haskell and Beyond'
      speaker="Amar Shah"
      description="Tacit programming, or programming in the “point-free” style, allows you to define a function without reference to some or all of its arguments. Let’s develop an intuition for point-free programming, probe its origins, and consider its trade-offs."

      title='Program Derivation for Functional Programs'
      speaker="Felienne Hermans"
      description="Despite what your boss thinks, programs don’t just appear straight out of specifications. But…what if they did?In this session I will show you how to systematically and step-by-step derive a program from a specification. Functional languages especially are very suited to derive programs for, as they are close to the mathematical notation used for proofs.You will be surprised to know that you already know and apply many techniques for derivation, like Introduce Parameter as supported by Resharper. Did you know that is actually program derivation technique called generalization?"

      title='Negotiating Salary for Women in Tech'
      speaker="Ashley Powell"
      description="I’ve been negotiating salary and rate with and on behalf of IT consultants for years, and firmly believe that a major contributor to the wage gap is that women don’t negotiate their salaries. So from the first job we take, we’re behind the curve and never catch up.I’ll present the theories behind how to negotiate and demonstrate how it should actually sound. We’ll cover how to understand your worth, when to stick to your guns and how to use benefits and flexibility to build a great package for yourself. I’ll give an insider’s look into negotiating with recruiters, and give you the tools to establish a firm footing for a great salary negotiation."

      title='Fetching Moths from the Works: Correctness Methods in Software'
      speaker="Brian L. Troutwine"
      description="<p>We live in a nice world. There’s a wealth of historical thought on achieving correctness in software–shipping code that does only what is intended, not less and not more–and there are a whole bunch of methods available to us as practitioners. Some of these are hard to apply, some are easy. For instance, case testing is widely used and considered standard practice. Property testing is understood to exist but not widely used. The application of advanced logics? Way out there.</p><p>If you look around you’ll find a lot of software fails a lot of the time. Why is that?</p><p>In this talk I’ll give an overview of the methods for producing correct systems and will discuss each in its historical context. With each method, we’ll keep an eye out for present applications and the difficulty of doing so. We’ll discuss why there’s so much buggy software in the world. I expect there will be talk of spaceships a bit.</p><p>By the end of this talk you ought to be able to make reasoned decisions about applying correctness methods in your own work and have a good shot at building better software.</p>"

      title='Recursion: Where Functional Programming Hits Bottom'
      speaker="Greg Pfeil"
      description="What are the problems with recursion? How can they be resolved while improving both the performance and clarity of your code? In this talk, we’ll learn how to separate recursion from the semantics of our program using generalized recursion schemes. We’ll discover the benefits that come from that approach and identify some pitfalls that may seem helpful at first. We will also see how to adopt this style gradually in existing projects, gaining the benefits incrementally without disrupting code that already works. Most of the content is language agnostic (but typed), with specific examples given in Haskell and Scala."

      title='Tulip: A Well-Balanced Language'
      speaker="Jeanine Adkisson"
      description="There are a lot of competing ideas about what makes a language “good”. This is because we as language designers still have no idea what we’re doing. The design of Tulip is based on careful study of a wide variety of popular and esoteric programming languages over about 4 years. Its runtime takes cues from Erlang, and its syntax is slightly like ML, but with a few key innovations designed for repl ergonomics. Tulip is one of the new languages to come out of the language community Snek, emphasizing languages by minority designers and implementers."

      title='Planet 9 from Other Space, and other things found in Big(ger) Data'
      speaker="Dr. Pamela Gay"
      description="Modern all-sky surveys are enabling new kinds of discoveries by allowing statistical studies to trace out the locations of hidden planets, pressures, and exoplanets. The most exciting of these discoveries is Planet 9, a new world predicted by the orbits of icy Kuiper Belt Objects and defined by where it isn't in all-sky surveys. It follows on the heels of projects that map out invisible dark matter and describe Dark Energy's expansion of the universe.This talk will look at how massive data collections have allowed us to detect these and other things that can't be seen, and how future data sets will make today's Big Data seem small."

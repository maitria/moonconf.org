    <p>Our venues are ADA compliant, <strong>accessible for the mobility impaired</strong>. (Note that the Hotel Boulderado is historical, so only some rooms are accessible. They work around any problems.)</p>
    <p>Please let us know if you require other accomodation. <strong>We intend to be accessible to everyone who wants to come.</strong> Twitter DMs are open, or email any organizer (first_name@moonconf.org).</p>
